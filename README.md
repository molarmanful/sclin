> A concatenative cyborg chimera.

**sclin** is a programming language that leans heavily into its weirdness. Some
of its features include:

- **Postfix notation** - sclin reads left-to-right with no precedence rules.
  _Concatenation is composition!_
- **The Stack** - sclin's FIFO stack serves as both storage and a "staging
  ground" for function arguments. This - in tandem with stack manipulation
  commands - enables an intuitive point-free style that mirrors those found in
  functional languages.
- **Line-jumping** - sclin treats each line as a separate function, enabling
  "GOTO"-style line execution commands to create recursion and other control flow
  structures.
- **Vectorization** - Most of sclin's built-in commands vectorize, which allow
  those commands to operate on arbitrarily nested data structures.
- **Concise symbols** - sclin's commands follow a pictographic language to
  convey and distinguish properties.
- **Type fluidity** - Most (if not all) sclin commands auto-convert types as
  necessary, eschewing type safety for flexibility and expressiveness.
