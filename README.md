> A concatenative cyborg chimera.

**sclin** is a programming language that leans heavily into its weirdness. Some of its features include:

- **Postfix notation** - sclin reads left-to-right with no precedence rules. *Concatenation is composition!*
- **The Stack** - sclin's FIFO stack serves not only as storage, but also as a "staging ground" for function arguments. This - in tandem with stack manipulation commands - enables an intuitive point-free style that mirrors those found in functional languages.
- **Line-jumping** - sclin treats each line as a separate function, enabling "GOTO"-style line execution commands to create recursion and other control flow structures.
- **Vectorization** - Many of sclin's commands are vectorized, which allows those commands to operate on arbitrarily nested data structures.
- **Concise symbols** - sclin's commands follow a pictographic language to convey and distinguish properties.
- **Type fluidity** - Each of sclin's base types implement extensive interconversion. Many commands auto-convert types as necessary, eschewing type safety for flexibility and expressiveness.
